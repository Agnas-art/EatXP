## ⚔️ Boss Battle: Refined Carb Phantom

### Boss Opening Cutscene

```
⚡ REFINED CARB PHANTOM - THE PHANTOM EMERGES ⚡

The golden Grain Plains grow dark as a ghostly figure emerges from the shadows.
Its form shimmers with the shimmer of white bread, instant noodles, and sugary cereals.
The phantom drains the golden color from the crops as it approaches.

"WELCOME, young Food Guardian... I am the Refined Carb Phantom!
I've been draining the ENERGY from these lands for far too long!

Why should anyone eat whole grains when refined carbs taste SO much better?
White bread is PURE and CLEAN! Refined flour is SUPERIOR!
Why suffer through brown rice when WHITE is so much more refined?

The villagers LOVE me... they crave the SWEETNESS I bring!
The temporary energy rush... the taste... they'll never choose fiber over ME!

Your pathetic whole grain knowledge means NOTHING against my power!
SURRENDER NOW and join me in the glory of processed perfection!"

The Phantom's laughter echoes as your energy begins to fade.
The farmers collapse around you, drained of vitality.
You must teach it the TRUTH about nutrition...
The power of WHOLE GRAINS... FIBER... SUSTAINED ENERGY!

This battle will determine the fate of the Grain Plains!
